## Technical skills

As a data scientist, I'm very well capable of taking a dataset, transforming the data, and building/training deep learning AI models to derive insights.

I'll separate my skills into their respective categories

<Steps>
### Tools

- **SIEM -** IBM QRadar, LogRhythm, ArcSight, Splunk

- **DFIR -** Redline, FTK Imager, Process Hacker, Procmon, Procdot, Autoruns, Regshot, HxD, REMnux, xdebug

### Data Science

- NumPy & Pandas
- Python, SQL
- Excel, PowerBI
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Tensorflow
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning (Supervised and Unsupervised learning)
- Building CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and other types of deep learning AI models
- Collaborative filtering methods, matrix factorization, and boltzmann machines (recomendation systems)
- Augmenting images (Preprocessing, CLAHE, etc), oversampling/undersampling imbalanced data, and other data manipulation techniques

Other relevant skills

- Benchmarking AI models, hyper-parameter tuning, building pipelines
- Cleaning, manipulating, and extracting data
- Creating visualizations, dashboards, and good verbal/writing skills to communicate my work
- Preprocessing data to train machine learning models
- Merging multiple sources of data such as databases to run analytics
- Building APIs and web crawlers

### Software engineering

- Programming languages - JavaScript, Python, SQL, Java, C (intermediate), Ruby, and Go (basic)
